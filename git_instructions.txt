Hello Ashton, this is an instruction page for getting the GitHub repository setup on your system for our project. I'd prefer if you learn how to use the Command Line and some basic commands

GETTING STARTED:
	0. Make sure you have Git installed on your computer to be able to use Git Commands on your Terminal. Here's a tutorial video:
		https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDRoduig_98

	1. Create a folder where you want to store all of the files in. Type command
		mkdir FIFA-Gravity

	2. Create a local git directory and pull the files from the online repository onto your computer. Type commands
		git init
		git remote add origin https://github.com/richardronyo/FIFA-Gravity.git
		git fetch
		git switch Ashton

DEVELOPING:
To make sure that the main branch is always updated properly, all changes or contributions any of us make need to be pushed to our own branches where we will then create aa Pull Request.
We want to avoid writing conflicting code that's already been completed.

	1. To ensure that we're all using the latest version of the code, before you begin developing type the following command:
		git merge origin/main

	2. When you're ready to push your changes to your branch type the following command:
		git push origin Ashton

	3. On the GitHub Repository you will see the option to create a Pull Request. Fill it out accordingly. I will review all requests before adding them to the main branch.
